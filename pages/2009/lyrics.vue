      <h2>Office</h2>

      <p>This way that, eyes like a cat<br>
      All sides of a room like a map<br>
      Roam thru stations, tail swish<br>
      Ears spin to catch a hot dish<br>
      Grown ass folks on some high school ish<br>
        Checks clear, what I gotta work with</p>

      <p>Good typa problems, daily grind<br>
      Driftin on the bus, dream in rhymes<br>
      Thinkin bout code at the exact same time<br>
      Headphones in the mines blastin mines<br>
      Stay rackin lines like I’m passin time<br>
        Some things never change, tragic mimes</p>

      <p>See the edge of never pullin up out of theory<br>
      Gettin older never felt so near me<br>
      Thinkin bout some places and some faces<br>
      Some I’ll never see again can’t quite face it<br>
      Hangin onto day ones for dear life<br>
        Learn to let go and not think twice</p>

      <p>Night time fire pit smoke with a whiskey<br>
      Rocks, all she wrote, clean to the socks<br>
      Legs with the tights and the rump just right<br>
      Givin me the rhythm like I just might<br>
      Wild for the spice with the appetite<br>
        The morning got weird, didn’t land it right</p>

      <p>Downtown lobby, heady throbby<br>
      Gonna be a long fuckin day at the jobby<br>
      Shoulda had a water tried to piss some out<br>
      Jump into a meeting try to talk my route<br>
      Day in half gear till Im outta here<br>
        Back to the spot let it all disappear</p>
      <p>Till then<br>
      This way that, eyes still track<br>
      Made a little name as the Chicago cat<br>
      Odd little kingdom, tail swish<br>
        Checks clear, coins gotta click</p>

      <h2>Revels</h2>

      <p>Lemme get that</p>

      <p>I keep with that steady steady,<br>
      Adobe shit I’m ready ready,<br>
      Builds I got plenty plenty,<br>
        Pit boss has already met me,</p>

      <p>I’m out with that Dazy gentry,<br>
      Handsome fucks you envy envy,<br>
      Buy the round and get me friendly,<br>
      Flyest sound around no use pretending</p>

      <p>Up to the same old flame with the brain hold<br>
      Cup run a flood for the love of the game blow<br>
      Chains of the same gold, reign of a brave soul<br>
        A love supreme for the message in the main role</p>

      <p>I keep with that steady steady<br>
        MIDI clocks we ready ready</p>

      <h2>Regular</h2>

      <p>I been gettin money on the reg, reg, regular</p>

      <p>Island off an alley with the lights on lonely<br>
      Family in the house, cheese and macaroni<br>
      Up again with Ableton, workin on my tickys<br>
        Muted nonsense with Julian, Bubbles and Ricky</p>

      <p>Boom from the 3rd gen Battery I utilized<br>
      Hits get crunched out, kicks get brutalized<br>
      Breaks off the 2500 MIDI supervise<br>
        Finally realize the dreams of youthful pride</p>

      <p>Coffee on the skydecks with empire builders<br>
      Level up the layer cake, elite hired killers<br>
      On track with the contracts and the bombast<br>
        Not a drop of sweat on a monthly note for Comcast</p>

      <p>More the same for almost 8 years<br>
      Flash ran everything, then it disappeared<br>
      And this badass ActionScript hacker impassioned with<br>
        A savage gift smashed it and cracked the establishment</p>

      <p>Rack em at Rialto, two off the break<br>
      Lunch and libations for 88’s the great<br>
      Spark the DeLorean, back in time<br>
        Gun range in Clackamas, rackin a 9</p>

      <p>Dirt pit in Washington, squeezin off rounds<br>
      Still dig in junk bins for sounds to be found<br>
      Still puttin words together while I walk around the town<br>
        Still coppin corner CD’s to feed the underground</p>

      <p>Dizzy got a brand new bang with his slang</p>

      <p>I can’t believe it’s been a dime since 09<br>
      Before it went bust, all tryin to be fine<br>
      Foregone finales end the same every time<br>
        No use in delusion, no use for illusion</p>

      <p>Flowers and gats, mixtapes and spoiler posts<br>
      Days in the saltmine styling up the royal host<br>
      Once-in-a-while, hooky with the day at the coast<br>
        Talkin trash with the kids, Mario Kart roasts</p>

      <p>Egg on toast, I made it a votive<br>
        Years soppin up the yolks, I stayed devoted</p>

      <h2>Last</h2>

      <p>It’s a very melancholy and romantic concept, “the last time”, the reality rarely meets the expectation. Disengaging from my old life and building my new life were not simple single moments, there was no Great Switch that was thrown, it was a lot of little switches along the way. But each little switch was a connection, and many have remained closed.</p>

    <p>The last time I was at Dr Wax, also the last time I saw Brandie in person. Many of us went back to Evanston to say goodbye to a record store that had been our nest for years.</p>

    <p>Another life and another nest, the last time I shopped at 360 Vinyl, talking hip hop with the DJ who owned the store. Pretty sure his name was Dave, I’d see him on the bus periodically after.</p>

    <p>The last time I was at that little cafe on Fremont next to Peter’s, the owner was an energetic little pixie, very bright and bubbly, a former promoter with a thousand unlikely tales of local scenes</p>

    <p>The last time my babydev group walked from the Bookhouse to restaurant row on Burnside, arguing about which mediocre eatery would provide us that day our daily bread.</p>

    <p>The last time The Three Kings from Evanston all rolled into a dive bar to grab a greasy hangover breakfast and watched the Bears play, or the last time we all played music together.</p>

    <p>The last time I flew from Chicago to Portland and felt like I was leaving home instead of going to it.</p>

    <p>These things all happen so slowly, so quietly, one small tick at a time. That’s why it’s so rare that you know it’s the last time, when it’s the last time.</p>
