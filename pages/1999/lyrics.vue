      <h2>Car</h2>

      <p>Skills airtight like a zip lock<br>
      Body rocker dropper on the kick knock<br>
      Four elements to the flip flops<br>
        Nothing more hip hop than rappin bout hip hop</p>

      <p>My flows whiff of wickedness, vocabulatrix limitless<br>
      I’ll pound a primitive clown to insignificance<br>
      Drown a diminutive and never admit to it<br>
        Won’t own up to the major sins or any little bit of shit</p>

      <p>Soft kids get pistol whipped and dog walked with witnesses<br>
      By lifelong recidivists who never go legitimate<br>
      Just for the click of it, poles and positions in<br>
        Starter pistol popped and it locked the conditioning</p>

      <p>All good infantry, hungry for hood infamy<br>
      Cooler than your common sense, couldn’t find the bitch in me<br>
      Take the time with indigenous history, the miseries<br>
        Disasters from the devil’s ministry of dark mysteries</p>

      <p>What lingers? Paper tigers turned Cringers<br>
      Wrappers off the Zingers, eat em with lady fingers<br>
      Canned cannibal dinners, throne of skulls to the winner<br>
        Stretch with young bucks to keep limber, Timber!</p>

      <p>Chop fall set flips to drop drawls<br>
      Peter panty peeler had em down by law<br>
      With the art of jabber jaw, honed via slammer scrawls<br>
        Bass man Dapper Dan with his jabber paws</p>

      <p>Scratch if it’s itchy, cross fade it back in a jiffy<br>
      You can catch a quick cross hook if you’re lippy<br>
      Born Slippy only made sense that one time in the dorm trippin<br>
        Next day hair of the dog born tipsy</p>

      <p>Hand on a fat ass like a rapper Tom Petty<br>
      Another dude’s girl, I was beyond petty<br>
      I would fuck your girl, I was beyond sleazy<br>
        We were all young hoes and it was way too easy</p>

      <p>Hand on a fat ass like grabbin the horizon<br>
      Carpe diem, launch to new environs<br>
      Chain smoke, Diddy said don't stop supplyin<br>
        Slashed ourselves on the rocky crawl to the sirens</p>

    <section>

      <p>Dominance asserted cross continents, wonder where the<br>
      Objects went, corn field buzz bomb a moderate<br>
      Forget about your problems, sit with polar opposites<br>
        The world’s full of shit and we’ve got a lot of it</p>

      <h2>Cypher</h2>

      <p>Yo<br>
      I brake hopes, take throats and scrape notes<br>
      I can ape quotes off an educated rote<br>
        Self medicate and soak, elevate the scope</p>

      <p>Run rambunctious slay simulants by the dozens<br>
      ATM warbots storebought by the dozens<br>
        Stay scared shitless cuz the end of times is coming</p>

      <p>Slaves to new systems fear collapse of the infant<br>
      A two digit difference and it won’t go the distance<br>
        It will all crash into dust in the finish</p>

      <p>Giant mechs cities wrecked, catch it all on VHS<br>
      Forbidden tech spins cassettes, samplers vivisect<br>
        Reading recipes, misstep to disrespect</p>

      <p>Faux paw, false flaggin role call, cold claws<br>
      Sabre rattle anthems put stress to known flaws<br>
        Brothers of the banner still follow old laws</p>

      <p>Given in the desert, visions in the measure<br>
      Infinite potential with no limit to the treasure<br>
        Sittin unfettered in stolen war feathers</p>

      <p>An odd approximation from recorded observations<br>
      Purported conversations in a sordid modulation<br>
        Stories gain support until they push the obligation</p>

      <p>One way or another, Sunday service with the brothers<br>
      Undercover thugger when it’s all guns and butter<br>
        What the hand of man has done is rent asunder</p>

      <p>Tres, tres, tres<br>
      Tres, tres, tres</p>

      <h2>Basement</h2>

      <p>The Return of the rhythm ripper, Mr Wahl clipper<br>
      Find a fire loop and build it a perfect slipper<br>
      Old sound Cinderella, still got the stickers<br>
        Experiment will all kinds of weird shit as MIDI triggers</p>

      <p>Messageboard, messageboard, give me some tips<br>
      Sound nerd community, zips of one hits<br>
      Stacks of burned CD-ROMs full of drum rips<br>
      For MPCs or ACID, two cooks for tough shit</p>

      <p>Pollen of the Flower of Life, engineered by<br>
      Legendary weaponeers empowered by spice<br>
      Assassin in a dowager’s life, trained in ancient<br>
        Deadly arts and endowed with a mind like a knife</p>

      <p>So Let's cut to the premise, Young Money gettin lettuce<br>
      Dude talked about a chain but ain’t seen a dentist<br>
      No chance to prevent it, earned it after he spent it<br>
        And now Young Gummy cant even stomach lettuce</p>

      <p>All in for irony, we get it all with piracy<br>
      Don’t ask for receipts, I wouldn’t ask you to lie to me<br>
      Do it for the pioneers, the Crash Crew Dynasty<br>
        The old time emcees who didn’t die violently</p>

      <p>Took all their rage and kept it in the rivalry<br>
      Cipher society had rules of propriety<br>
      Designed to be a future of self made notoriety<br>
        Skills make the man, a battle plan like sobriety</p>

      <h2>Radio</h2>

      <p>Yes yes yall, and ya don't quit<br>
      And ya don't stop, makin hot shit<br>
      Yes yes yall, and ya don't stop<br>
      And ya don't quit, real hip hop</p>

      <p>You heard it on the radio, breakbeats on the radio<br>
      You heard it on the radio, happy scracthin on the radio<br>
      You heard it on the radio, happy rappin on the radio<br>
      You heard it on the radio, happy music on the radio</p>

      <p>You heard it on the radio</p>

      <h2>Temple</h2>

      <p>It’s been 20 years since I was 21<br>
      First learned to hack a page source for fun<br>
      We all looked to Main Source for drums<br>
        Edge of the future the next had begun</p>

      - - - - -

      <p>Life off Diversey, Brown Line to Blue<br>
      Korean BBQ to quesadillas for the crew<br>
      Cheap beer cheap smokes weak hopes sneak<br>
        Like a card in the bike spokes rattle for the new</p>

      <p>Dollar bin grabs cheap vinyl by the foot<br>
      Music education while we diggin for the hook<br>
      Read everything I could, did it by the book<br>
        Scrapin beat tapes together, do it for the look</p>

      <p>Last of the actual cassettes, real time sets<br>
      Tiny little mixer with the cords to the decks<br>
      More bass more thump floor bump war<br>
        Had begun, everyone runs for the number one</p>

      <p>Up and down this dark city, Alexander Proyas<br>
      College kids Cub Foods, gettin it with Goya<br>
      Screams of machines that will come to destroy ya<br>
        Round out a decade of fear and paranoia</p>

      <p>They got X-Files on everything, mountains in Montana<br>
      Behold a Pale Horse, bodega propaganda<br>
      Strawberry ice cream, grays in the cabana<br>
        Tin foil hats with that Freemason grammar</p>

      <p>Early morning local access, beer on the mattress<br>
      Out of town DJs killin ears with theatrics<br>
      Better let’em have it, triumph to the tragic<br>
        We tell our own stories, sciences established</p>
