      <h2>Rain</h2>

      <p>8x<br>Tip tip tipper tap, tip tipper tap</p>

      <p>Drops hit the sidewalks, tip tipper tap<br>
      Gray skies stretch long, tip tipper tap<br>
      Hot cup of coffee, tip tipper tap<br>
        Chattin on the morning, tip tipper tap</p>

      <p>Roadways slick lights, tip tipper tap<br>
      Wool coats pulled tight, tip tipper tap<br>
      Razor winds blow tough, tip tipper tap<br>
        Warm stream toes up, tip tipper tap</p>

      <p>4x<br>Sittin on the porch listenin to tipper tap</p>

      <p>Gray clouds roll along, tip tipper tap<br>
      Sit low on the hills, tip tipper tap<br>
      Sky like a dull mash, tip tipper tap<br>
        Winter made of soft light, tip tipper tap</p>

      <p>2x<br>
      Walk thru the streets in between the tipper tap<br>
      Keep my head in some beats, boom tikka clap<br>
      Grown man’s boots walkin on a wicked path<br>
        I stay in SE like that pickup by the trap</p>

      <p>4x<br>
      That good Rose City life, tip tipper tap</p>

      <h2>Grim</h2>

      <p>Some things constant, don't change in the drift<br>
      I stomp my lanes all the same in my shift<br>
      The game and the gift I was drained at the rift<br>
        but remain I exist on the plane, I insist</p>

      <p>Forever with the fanfare, common folk, street level<br>
      Type cats who didn't catch Obama's hope<br>
      Son of a native son who don't trust your promise note<br>
        Still makin all ends meet, domino</p>

      <p>See me out there with the heat,  it's improbable<br>
      Duct tape with weight on the street, it's illogical<br>
      I would not wait on a beef, keep it topical<br>
        And I'm away on retreat with a popsicle</p>

      <p>Gangster shit, I'd rather not but if the plot<br>
      Will rot through the floor like acid blood through the slots<br>
      I don't know a lot but my fam in some blocks<br>
        Will not tolerate that mess oh no they will not</p>

      <p>And some dude will wonder why he's mopped on the spot<br>
      Lights out for good he went wood when it popped<br>
      Street legend immortal the talk of the shop<br>
        A lesson for those who feel destined to top</p>

      <p>Still a restless day dreamer, heathen and a true believer<br>
      Raised in an age where you could die for sneakers<br>
      So it's hard to hold faith, turn away the seekers<br>
        The trope is a fiction, the killer’s not a preacher</p>

      <p>I’m not one either, we are the everyone<br>
      All indulge in fantasies of what we’ve never done<br>
      I’ve got a thousand ways I could have been a better son<br>
      Some things sidelined for days that never come</p>

      <h2>Arena</h2>
      <p>Now it's now, how now brown cow, the<br>
      Leader loves a kow tow from yes men downtown<br>
      Showdown at high noon, it's quarter past ten and still<br>
        Half the room about to die soon before it ends</p>

      <p>They love pretend in virtual Colosseums<br>
      But then it still spends cuz it's where we all see em<br>
      Meanwhile the real world is crumbling to Eden<br>
        Now more than ever we all scream for freedom</p>

      <p>Moms says it all moves in cycles, the flags and the rifles,<br>
      Small men who start war over trifles<br>
      They demand loyalty, like off brand royalty<br>
        Let's go kill some brown folks and set their oil free</p>

      <p>Vox of the metropolis and farmland fury<br>
      The hands that keep em aggravated, stirring up the slurry<br>
      If you spin it fast enough it all stays blurry<br>
        The ones who built this mess will never see a jury</p>

      <p>What, me worry? We're cracked to the core<br>
      Cornered and the world flipped, we're back to the floor<br>
      Got the values you need, racks at the store<br>
        As long as you can afford, slaps to the poor</p>

      <p>Fake faith in Christ makes a joke of belief<br>
      Claim to love life while guns choke the streets<br>
      Cowboys stories, the good guys in white, with gats<br>
        And clear eyes, but they love a dirty fight</p>

      <h2>Nos</h2>

      <p>I accept the things I cannot change and can't get pressed<br>
      If the world ends next week I got plans for the rest<br>
      Take my daughter to the ocean in a hella cute dress<br>
        If we all die anyway then fuck that extra stress</p>

      <p>I cherish every second that I’m with her<br>
      Even when she’s bratting out and jumping on my triggers<br>
      The little hands that reached out to gain understanding<br>
        The little eyes that shined from her first moment landing</p>

      <p>Everything changed from the morning she dropped in<br>
      They say it’s a cliche but the world really stopped on a pin<br>
      The difference that a day makes when new love begins<br>
        The truth is I wouldn’t want to be the same again</p>

      <p>Now we shine brighter, it pushed the sky wider<br>
      The path got clear and I straightened out my visor<br>
      Proud son of South E, scenester survivor<br>
        Now with my greatest glitch, a bona fide franchiser</p>

      <p>, Cruzat and father ain’t even bothered<br>
      Tiny tyrant toddler and her favorite furry monster<br>
      Best gig of all time, Papa<br>
        Every day stronger like a young Queen Kong</p>

      <p>Latest in two long lines of scrappers and boxers<br>
      My loopy little goofy, dainty dolly doctor<br>
      Best addition yet to the roster, she sees and she<br>
        Conquers and prospers, my clever daughter</p>

      <h2>Sol</h2>

      <p>Some folks determined to live their lives in conflict<br>
      Even worse they stoke it all for profit, the turn of a terrible<br>
      Topic, keep em addicted and myopic<br>
        It’s all about the butter, bay-bay, who gonna stop it</p>

      <p>I accept the things I can’t change, this much is true<br>
      We won’t change each others’ minds and you’re wrong, so fuck you<br>
      Whole gang of hypocrites on thin ice, fuck you<br>
        Pick and choose the scriptures you like, fuck you</p>

      <p>I was taught to fear G-d, I don’t think that you fear G-d<br>
      Or if G-d were to speak that you could even hear G-d<br>
      Your daddy is a devil in the deep, this much is true<br>
        You choose the company you keep, so fuck you</p>

      <p>Cowards who don’t want to feel the shame, fuck you<br>
      The powers that seal us in the game, fuck you<br>
      Grandad was a racist and a lame, fuck you<br>
        And you’re turning out just the same so fuck you</p>

      <p>My grandfather was kind of a racist too, fuck you<br>
      I can love him and recognize that it’s true, fuck you<br>
      We’ve all got some work we can do, fuck you<br>
        And it’s not all about your little bruise, fuck you</p>

      <p>Some folks determined to keep fighting<br>
      Big Brother Dave told me don't ever stop writing<br>
      We’ve all got our callings, this much is true<br>
        And I’m gonna keep talking my shit, so fuck you</p>
