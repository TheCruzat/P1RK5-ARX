      <h2>credo</h2>
      <p>Lemme get that old fashioned hip hop music<br />
      Break and a loop like it ain't nothing to it<br />
      Lake to the stoop, how it gets my folks through it<br />
      Street level kids from the beemers to the buicks</p>

      <p>Let’s bump it back to sets, labels on black cassettes<br />
      Demos on the demographic, who raps it best<br />
      Dollars on a distro, home dub TDKs<br />
      Inserts at Kinkos, the bug here to stay</p>

      <p>Shows live energy, seas of sweating frenemies<br />
      Basements and back rooms, 500 pennies<br />
      Flyers like mementos, handbill keepsakes<br />
      Too adored to wind up in landfills,</p>

      <p>Gemini looper, straight hand skills, real time<br />
      Feel prime, just gettin wheels on the line<br />
      Young dumb bubble gum, feels on the mind<br />
      Young catch as catch can, feels on behind</p>

      <p>All in the endless eternal relentless<br />
      Inferno of hormones, start the life sentence<br />
      Drives for affection, all forms of attention<br />
      Some go to extremes and wind up defendants</p>

      <p>I remember Mario, moments on Main St<br />
      Southeast E, the salad bowl that hazed me<br />
      Some cats will never make it back for the reunion<br />
      So I never saw the point in going back for a reunion</p>

      <p>I walked the night and saw what the world did to you<br />
      Still remember every inch of shit we been through<br />
      But like Tariq said with that flow like a ginsu<br />
      I shall, proceed, and continue</p>

      <h2>posture</h2>
      <p>Keep it street like hand to hand, demands and reprimands<br />
      That weak shit will never stand against these clever plans<br />
      Let it bang to Neverland, payback for the tortured<br />
        Maybachs to the porch, blow the spot and let it scorch</p>

      <p>Balls in four courts, keep service, rounds endless<br />
      Cuts to the wax like a pack of proud dentists<br />
      Doin it the old way, no painkiller pendants<br />
        No hotcue keys, just a sticker on the record</p>

      <p>Requiring encyclopedic knowledges for content<br />
      12 seconds gotcha feelin rich with the sonics<br />
      Buzz in the basket kept the bees in the bonnet<br />
        Beats matched by hand, sweet in the pocket</p>

      <p>Locally sourced, innocent innovation<br />
      The spark that lifts off a life of levitation<br />
      Every point connects to the original equation<br />
        In the distance sits the Omega, but until then</p>

      <p>Me and this heat are still friends like a quill pen<br />
      Links to the ink, blood money still spends<br />
      Pray for easy days, chill friends and relations<br />
        Breezy in breezeway with no trepidation</p>

      <p>Cuz<br />
        4x  I’ll be on the mic with my styles like,</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>boasts</h2>


      <p>No need to warn ya, I'm in the corner<br />
      Blowing up the mic like a universal soldier<br />
      Rip it up, flexin, I spit to perfection<br />
        Rhyme styles defy analysis or inspection</p>

      <p>Go and get your gadgets, the average can't hack it<br />
      Disrupt the planet with the language of havoc<br />
      Sufficiently advanced tech mistaken for magic<br />
        Wrap cocaine in wholesome and call it Bob Saget</p>

      <p>Papa’s got a brand new hit for the drummer<br />
      Crates gonna drop a lotta shit for the plumber<br />
      Hold it up and blow it out, stiggity bum wonder<br />
      And still got the flow to mack your girl for her number</p>

      <p>Dead serious, effects for das bottom of der woofer<br />
      Like troopers from the future who jump back to shoot ya<br />
      Sent by the deep blue computer with a looper<br />
        But I’m super duper, cuter than your suitors</p>

      <p>All charm and excellence, selfish intelligence<br />
      I’m out to get it by any standard measurement<br />
      Hot blooded temperment, cool it with a snapple<br />
        Bottle it up for the amateur battles</p>

      <p>I been out on Cermak for chicken fried rice<br />
      Posers all salty I been gettin my slice<br />
      Reppin my spice and the spice must flow<br />
        Now who wanna pop at Necro Pondr on the grow</p>

      <p>All in, all phenomenal<br />
      Defoe in the desert all despondent for his obstacles<br />
      Split to the follicles, every part of buffalo<br />
        Pushin at the gruesome bits, hairnets keep it loveable</p>

      <p>I never had to flip a sandwich for a buck<br />
      My homies in the aprons never had that kinda luck<br />
      City lights callin till it’s 5 in the morning<br />
        Suns up crowin and the whole crew is yawning</p>

      <h2>lake</h2>

        <p>The world feels young, like it's only just begun</p>

        <p>I was in the streets with my backpack and black fitted<br />
          Steady writing every day, whole book of raps spitted
        </p>

      <h2>Wild</h2>

      <p>25 years since I was 16<br />
      All I wanted was dope gear and beat machines<br />
      Middle class kid with some big budget dreams<br />
        Had a hundred notebooks splitting at the seams</p>
      -

      <p>Nothin like 1994, had my Chevy<br />
      Bangin steady pedal to the floor<br />
      On the 94 and got it up to 94<br />
        Some moments frozen till the day I'm 94</p>

      <p>Spirit of the 78 and seven-deuce<br />
      Some kids like a little fight to get loose<br />
      Sherman Ave parking garage on the roof<br />
        Jody on the ledge all jokes for the crew</p>

      <p>Echoes on the shoreline, lake in the distance<br />
      A-Zone Saturdays, infants in resistance<br />
      I brought a girl to food not bombs just to squeeze her tiddits<br />
        And I did it, holy shiddit she fiddled my diddick</p>

      <p>Precum and physics, a time for education<br />
      Read the Tao Te Ching and did my daily meditation<br />
      Start to dig in the basement for instrumentation<br />
        2.5 second samples adding up to greatness</p>

      <p>Everybody on that tape shit, mixtapes to demos<br />
      Soundbites from indies, Keitel all mellow<br />
      Lost a lot of sleep when it’s all done and settled<br />
        Worth it when you see the cuties bouncing that jello</p>

        <p>2x<br />
      HELLO, bet it ain't jam when you hear the beats slam<br />
      Pete the beast, dreads bleached, thieves in the van<br />
      Hot summer nights and the future in our hands<br />
        If you have to ask you may never understand</p>

      <p>4x <br>If you have to ask, you may never understand</p>

      <p>All the beachfronts in Evanston are lined with rocks, these pieces of smashed up buildings and old construction. Part of being a bored kid in that town is crawling up and down the rocks at the lake. Part of being a bored teen is going there to smoke weed, drink, make out, part of being a scared teen is stashing your shit and running from cops. It’s still part of the fabric of that town for semi-dangerous gangs of bored teens to travel in packs at night, looking for trouble and flirting with criminal instincts. Maybe some things will never change.</p>
